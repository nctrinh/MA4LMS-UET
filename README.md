# MA4LMS-UET

**MA4LMS-UET** is a multi-agent system designed to assist students at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET) in their learning process. It leverages LLMs and structured workflows to provide intelligent, modular support for tasks such as retrieving course materials, managing knowledge graphs, and delegating responsibilities among agents.

## ðŸ¤– Multi-Agent Architecture

The system is built with a modular multi-agent design, including:

* **supervisor_agent**
    The central coordinator. It receives user input, routes tasks to the appropriate agent, and returns the final result.

* **kg_agent**
    Handles information retrieval and course-related queries, such as listing courses, downloading files, or checking assignments.

* **build_knowledge_graph_agent**
    Responsible for constructing and updating the knowledge graph database that represents course and learning content structure.
